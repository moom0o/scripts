My yt-dlp scripts

How to use:
You may need an updated ffmpeg version to merge videos to mp4. Download the latest xz release tarbell at the bottom of https://ffmpeg.org/download.html, extract it with tar -xf file.xz, then move the ffmpeg file to /usr/bin/.
1: Make sure you have download.sh and upload.sh in the same folder, the rest of the scripts aren't neccessary.
2: Make sure yt-dlp is installed, download at https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
3: Make sure internet archive cli is installed, download at https://archive.org/services/docs/api/internetarchive/installation.html
4: Create an archive.org account.
5: Run 'ia configure', follow the onscreen prompts and input your archive.org email and password. Press enter. You should be all set now.
6: Once done creating an archive.org account, click 'UPLOAD' in the top right corner of archive.org.
7: Click "UPLOAD FILES"
8: Upload anything, we need to upload something in order to create the collection, you can simply upload a text file, the rest will be accomplished with the CLI.
9: Fill out proper metadata for the youtube channel/video you are archiving, try to give as many tags as possible, channel creation date, and description of the channel. Also make sure to choose "Community Movies" collection.
10: Click "Upload and Create Your Item", and wait. This may take a couple minutes depending on how busy archive.org is.
11: Once finished uploading, copy the text in the url AFTER THE PART: 'https://archive.org/details/'. This is important for adding to the command of the script.
12: Run 'bash download.sh https://www.youtube.com/user/CHANNEL_URL/videos ARCHIVEORGCOLLECTIONURL' make sure to replace the youtube link with the one you want to archive, and replace ARCHIVEORGCOLLECTIONURL with the text you copied above. You can also upload a single video if you'd like.

Once each video fully downloads and uploads to archive.org, it will automatically be deleted from your system to save storage. Your video will show up on the archive.org collection in a couple of minutes to an hour, depending on how busy archive.org is. You can check status by clicking History on the collection page.

It helps to have a VPS as close as possible to archive.org's servers (California). My VPS is in NYC and gets 40MiB/s to archive.org. A server in Germany for example will only be in the Kilobytes.
